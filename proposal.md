PDX Trail: Education Game Project by Jenna M. Tucker

Overview:  PDX Trail is an educational game designed as a parody of the beloved
educational game The Oregon Trail.  The game mimics the quintessential elements
of the game play and lingo to satisfy nostalgia for The Oregon Trail.  While
The Oregon Trail simulates the shared historical experience of folks taking the
Oregon Trail, PDX Trail simulates a shared future where ecological hardship
sparks migration to the Cascades and the sprawling Portland area.  Players will
choose a level of difficulty for their game play, name their team members, and
choose an initial inventory including food, clothes, means of carrying their
inventory, basic tech, and social use items like music and books before they
set out.  Success along the trail will depend on player choices and luck both.
Foraging / scavenging will replace hunting as a way to subsidize inventory.
